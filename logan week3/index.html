                <h3>HTML5 Markup</h3>
                <p>Hypertext Markup Language revision 5 (HTML5) is markup language for the structure and presentation of World Wide Web contents. HTML5 supports the traditional HTML and XHTML-style syntax and other new features in its markup, New APIs, XHTML and error handling.</p>

                <h3>CSS3 styling</h3>
                <p>A cascading style sheet (CSS) is a Web page derived from multiple sources with a defined order of precedence where the definitions of any style element conflict. The Cascading Style Sheet, level 1 (CSS1) recommendation from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is implemented in the latest versions of the Netscape and Microsoft Web browsers, specifies the possible style sheets or statements that may determine how a given element is presented in a Web page.</p>

                <h3>JAVA/JAVA SCRIPT</h3>
                <p>Java programs typically perform calculations and the main "thinking" process on the server side or within a Java applet that must be downloaded first. JavaScript code, on the other hand, performs calculations and its "thinking" is always on the client side, the computer where the web page is accessed. For this reason, JavaScript code is often faster, sometimes almost instant. Java programs take a little bit of time (several seconds or more) to process.</p>
