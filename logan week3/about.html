                <p class="dark">we in our courses start by explaining that behind every site is a mix of special languages that your web browser understands, a web browse program you use to view the internet. The main way of describing any website is HTML which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.Insert a joke here about how geeks give things weird names and you are ready to explain where to find this Meta Language.Ask your trainees to go to a simple site view page source and we are ready to explain HTML.</p>
